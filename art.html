                                <p>Art is an essential part in our lives, playing a part in a plethora of roles and offering different meanings. The value of art is a juxtaposition itself. It is invaluable, yet its worth is often undermined by capitalists, who till this day, refuse to give Art its rightful position. This issue's Art section features Singapore-born artist, Yun Yi Tan. Tan is a sculptor and painter based in both London and Singapore. With an International Academic Merit Scholarship, she recently graduated with a First Class Honours in Bachelor of Fine art at University of East London. Although her journey has been decently humble, she works hard to produce works that are meticulously crafted to top her cohort in 2020. Currently back in Singapore, Tan is sharing her vast knowledge attained in London with students of all ages at an independent studio-based company. She wishes to continue her aspirations as an art curator after she succeeds in fulfiling a long-time goal to fund her own Master studies at the Royal Academy of Fine Art.

                                <p>In Tan's biography, she states that artworks have been traditionally created to last long or forever, and even if it is not, there is a practice of art restoration. Tan rebelled against the values of western art, exploring materials’ inherent nature of eventual decay, to push boundaries in the art world for it to sit alongside the ‘permanent’ works. Referencing nature, topographical landscapes and terraced rice paddy fields to create her works out of the mixing bowl. They undergo the aesthetics of decay and loss amongst the unforeseen degradation of materials, questioning if ephemerality can fight against the ‘traditional artificialities’ of art.

                                <p>In 2019, Tan held a group exhibition at Atrium Gallery - Old Biscuit Factory in London, titled “Selection Box”. Situating between large-scale paintings and sculptures, she has been ‘making’ and examining ephemeral materials over traditional painting’s anatomy. Apart from materials like latex, Tan has been introducing an alternative to a more affordable and biodegradable plastic, sodium alginate gel. Most of her works are produced out of the mixing bowl. This act of cooking and mixing touches with the traditional domestic role of women in the Asian society, where the majority dictates “cooking” a compulsory and a “must”. Tan’s art undergoes colour and surface changes over the duration of creative process making.
                                </p>
                                    <p>Referencing delicacy and fragility against the bold and present collages, she brings kitchen into her studio and shifted the relationship to the motif in a sculptural way. The investigation of this relationship between art and authenticity in the exhibition space endeavoured to a platform where fiction and fact are joined in a ‘theatrical’ adjournment of judgement. Tan's interest in psychogeography associates desire to convey her feelings that are similarly hidden in translucent layers, onto her delicate yet bold masterpiece. The tedious process of including different fragile textiles produced unique works that are rarely seen in the art scene these days. Growing up in a humble environment, Tan's interest in art started from attending a trial painting lesson. Although the trial did not successfully persuade her parents to sign her up for subsequent sessions, her passion grew and was stemmed from constant exclusion in social circles in school due to her petite character. Building up foundation in techniques, Tan was self-taught until she entered Secondary School, where art educators slowly unravelled her potential. Finally being able to attend external classes, she conitnued to emerge as a top scorer multiple times in tertiary and post-graduate education.

                    <h1>Who are we?</h1>
                    <p>Placid is an independent magazine created to advocate for the theme of Slow Living, with a mission to add a touch of calm to individuals who are struck by the effects of world issues amidst the already hectic life. At the same time, the magazine also hopes to contribute to efforts against the deteriorating health of Gaia.</p>
                        <p>Slow Living, like its name, is a lifestyle that emphasises a slower approach to aspects of everyday life, and movements or actions at a relaxed pace.
                        We hope this online magazine would help broaden perspectives and lend a helping hand amidst the global pandemic.</p>

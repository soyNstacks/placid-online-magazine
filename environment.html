                            <p>We have all heard of the news of clothing brands closing down physcial stores all around the globe in 2020, as the Covid-19 situation had (and still has) plans of its own. However, the unexpected happened. Small independent brands are thriving on online platforms, with a similar vision to help save planet Earth's environmental issues. In Singapore, there is a group of youngsters out on a mission to recycle, or rather upcycle, old clothes that would have ended up in the dumpsters without their effort. Firstly, what is slow fashion? Often confused with sustainable fashion, slow fashion refers to

                                </p>
                            <p>Although sustainable fashion helps reduce impact more so than slow fashion, the latter is still highly encouraged as baby steps are required in order to make a big change.

                            <p>Worn fabrics that do not fit into the current trends are constantly getting reworked into clothing that fulfil the hipsters' vibe. Armed with threads and needles, they help reduce textile waste by putting the 'brand new' clothes on sale via social media and online selling platforms like Instagram, Depop and Carousell. 
                            </p>
                                <p>DIY textile items are a major hit these days, with vintage and yarn-work occupying the top of the chart. Although most reworked shirts and trousers are made from old fabric, the prices are not as cheap as one might expect, albeit still affordable. The time and effort put into these work cannot be refuted once seen on the model. The exquisiteness and details expressed in the form of art have deeply moved the hearts and wallets of many. Aesthetic-wise, it has its own uniqueness. The best benefit is the minimised impact these clothes have on the environment.

                                    <p>One particular local online store that caught the eyes of Placid was 
                                        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thiccythrifts/?hl=en">"Thiccy Thrifts"</a>. 
                                        Behind this ludicrous name are two young women, Olivia and Megan, who are both alumnis of School of The Arts (SOTA). They had similar views on certain thrift shops that strive mainly on hefty profits and found interest in starting up their own selling platform on Instagram. With substantial amount of clothes from their wardrobes and a creative angle came Thiccy Thrifts in late 2019. Being self-taught, Olivia and Megan often execute individual ideas for discussion and construcive critique. Despite a quiet start, the store saw a rise in interest in mid 2020 during the peak of Covid-19, also when cross-broder trading was restricted by lockdown rules. The brand mainly focuses on affordability on top of sustainability, rather than full-on revenue based.

                            <p>In a recent Q&amp;A on Instagram, the women gathered opnions for selected questions provided by their followers. One of them questioned the reason why fast fashion is frowned upon. According to Olivia and Megan, fast fashion refers to low-cost clothing that are mass produced on a global level. These 'fast-fashion' brands release new collections rapidly, often utilising poor quality materials and placing manufacture points in third world countries with cheap labour, including children. Unfortunately, this contributes the top two CO2 emissions amongst all industries in the world. The excessive use of meagrely-priced polyester accounts for a-third of all microplastic wastes. 
                            Not forgetting to mention, the exploitation of children are hidden under a layer of promised golden opportunity to earn an income for their low-income family. Currently, Bangladeshi manufacturers are over a billion dollars in debt due to late minute cancellations by large retailers. Without any form of payment for the garments weaved and assemblied, the fabrics would be left to be discarded. When new trends emerge, these  factories and their underpaid employees can only abandon those clothes for the next mass production.

                    <h1>Who are we?</h1>
                    <p>Placid is an independent magazine created to advocate for the theme of Slow Living, with a mission to add a touch of calm to individuals who are struck by the effects of world issues amidst the already hectic life. At the same time, the magazine also hopes to contribute to efforts against the deteriorating health of Gaia.</p>
                        <p>Slow Living, like its name, is a lifestyle that emphasises a slower approach to aspects of everyday life, and movements or actions at a relaxed pace.
                        We hope this online magazine would help broaden perspectives and lend a helping hand amidst the global pandemic.</p>

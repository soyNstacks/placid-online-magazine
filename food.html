                        <p>The pandemic has caused people all around the world to lose touch with usual routines, including eat habits. Although the food and beverage industry has been hit hard, business is gradually picking up for most, especially in countries that are in the midst of recovery. Hence, profit-driven food delivery companies release new inticing coupons every week to capture the hearts, or stomachs, of civilians who are looking to continue enjoying food at their crib to reduce the risk of contacting the virus when eating out. There is definitely an increase in junk food consumption during this period of time.

                                <p>Slow Food aims to preserve traditional and regional cuisine and encourages the farming of plants, seeds and livestock characteristic of thhe local ecosystem. It is movement that opposes fast food, and focuses on quality rather than quantity. The organisation also advoactes responsible consumption.                         </p>

                        <p>The first approach to Slow Food is consuming local produce or 'clean' food. Purchasing food from local suppliers is a way to not only lend a helping hand to struggling small-scale producers, but could also ensues a fresher and cleaner diet. Fresh food gain an edge over the proccessed packets on the aisles of supermarket in terms of nutritional value and the absence of chemicals. The origin of local produce is usually transparent to consumers unlike certain food that are manufactured behind closed doors in factories. Knowing where food on the table comes from is a major winning point as well.
                        </p>    
                            <p>Additionally, a clean diet takes in the factor of potential extinction in the ecosystem. In risk of being endangered, it was discovered in 2007 that honey bees , which pollinate some edible vegetables, suffered mass die-offs. In Europe, mortality rates were around 20%, while in the United States they reached over 40% during the 2013 to 2014 winter. The alarming figures made its way to the headlines years back and has also since been in the minds of many. Although not entirely proven, the harvesting of honey from beehives, which  essentially is equivalent to the destruction of habitats, could be a contributing factor to the death toll. Hence, the the mission of Slow Food may also help improve dire environment impact from man's activities despite it being an issue that takes small steps in the long run. 
                            </p>
                                <p>Secondly, another approach is to preserve heritage dishes. In Singapore, there exists a volunteer-run and non-profit organisation, Slow Food (Singapore). Registered withh Slow Food (International), the independent community here is working to promote and preserve Singapore's traditional food cultural heritage through its events and programs.

                                    <a href="http://str.sg/4NRb">interview</a> 
                                    with The Strait Times in 2016, President of Slow Food (Singapore), Daniel Chia, revealed some interesting opinions regarding the mission. Below is an extracted short questionnaire transcipt.

                                has a toggle engine that allows individuals to search for the cultural cuisine they have in mind and provides a range of options available. Despite having limited options to date, the organisation expects a rise in members with the recent rise in interest in Slow Living and Slow Food. It has also been actively adding new approved heritage food sites to their page in accordance to several notable events like 
                                    <a href="https://slowfood.sg/kueh-appreciation-day/kueh-appreciation-day-2019/">'Kueh Appreciation Day'</a> 
                                and <a href="https://slowfood.sg/programs/heritage-heroes/">'Heritage Hero Awards Programme'</a>.
                                Striving towards the same goal, the community will certainly have sufficient resources to support their endeavours in time to come.

                    <h1>Who are we?</h1>
                    <p>Placid is an independent magazine created to advocate for the theme of Slow Living, with a mission to add a touch of calm to individuals who are struck by the effects of world issues amidst the already hectic life. At the same time, the magazine also hopes to contribute to efforts against the deteriorating health of Gaia.</p>
                        <p>Slow Living, like its name, is a lifestyle that emphasises a slower approach to aspects of everyday life, and movements or actions at a relaxed pace.
                        We hope this online magazine would help broaden perspectives and lend a helping hand amidst the global pandemic.</p>
